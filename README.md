AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively



This is for those companies who use daily planners in the workforce.
When you open our site, you will see the current day, and time displayed.
You will also see the operation hours, depending on the day listed.
You will be presented with time blocks, that you can add and save your daily appointments/shifts (etc) to.
This is also saved to local storage, and will still be present if you refresh the page!
The time blocks also have current time features, so you'll know whether the event has passed or is in the future.
The manager/office information is also listed at the bottom of the page.
